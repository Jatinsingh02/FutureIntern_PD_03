This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows two players to play against each other on the same device, and it checks for winning combinations or a tie automatically.

Features
1.Interactive GUI: A user-friendly graphical interface using tkinter.
2.Two-Player Game: Play against another person, with turns automatically alternating.
3.Winner/Tie Detection: The game detects and announces the winner or a tie at the end of each game.
4.Reset Functionality: Automatically resets the board after a game ends, ready for a new match.

Usage
1.Start the Game: When the game starts, Player X takes the first turn.
2.Make Your Move: Click on any empty cell in the 3x3 grid to place your mark (X or O).
3.Check the Result: The game will check for a winner after each move. If thereâ€™s a winner or a tie, a message box will display the result.
4.Play Again: The board resets automatically after the result is shown, allowing for another game.

Possible Enhancements
Here are some ideas for expanding the project:

1.Scoreboard: Implement a scoreboard to keep track of how many games each player has won.
2.AI Opponent: Add an AI opponent that players can compete against, either with a simple strategy or using algorithms like minimax.
3.Custom Styling: Enhance the visual appeal of the game by customizing the colors, fonts, and layout of the GUI.
4.Restart Button: Add a button that allows players to manually restart the game at any time.
